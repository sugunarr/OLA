Online Library Application (OLA) Version 2.0
============================================

Installation
============

Requirements
------------

OLA requires PHP4 to be set up and running. Downloaded the software at:
http://php.net/

OLA requires a database and recommends using MySQL. This can be
downloaded at:
http://mysql.com/

Other databases should work with OLA by making minor modifications to the
SQL statements throughout the project, and by specifying the database type 
in the db.inc.php file.

Instructions for Installing OLA
-------------------------------

1. Unzip the files into the web directory of your choice.

2. Edit the global variables declared in db.inc.php to match your
   database set up. This file is commented to help you with this
   task.

3. Create a database in MySQL using the database name, userid, and 
   password you declared for your database in the db.inc.php file.

   Ex. [Assuming the user and pwd have already been set up]

       # mysql -p -u sample_user
       Password: sample_pwd
       mysql> create database sample_db;
       mysql> exit

4. Prepare a spreadsheet of the books and other resources you plan
   on importing into the database, and save it as a text (CSV) file.

   Important: You cannot use the OLA program with an empty resource
   table. You will get errors when it discovers there are no categories
   and no subjects. The "Add New Resource" is only intended for casual
   use after *most* of the books have already been imported.

5. Create the database tables and import the resource file.

   Ex. # mysql -p -u sample_user sample_db
       Password: sample_pwd

       Then, cut and paste the SQL statements from the docs/tables.sql
       file into the SQL command line.

6. You may now visit your site on the internet without getting errors.
   Use the search feature to ensure that all your records were
   imported correctly.

7. Pick a username and password for the administrative login. (You can
   change it in the future at any time.) The password needs to be
   encrypted. Launch the page lib/set_password.php and enter your
   planned username and password. Copy the resulting text string after
   clicking on submit.

   Open the standard.inc.php file and paste the encrypted password in the
   correct line of the code. This file is commented to help you with this 
   task. At this time you can also set the other global variables listed
   in this file.

8. Done!
